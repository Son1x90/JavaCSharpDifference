# JavaCSharpDifference
This is the comparison of code in a small project between C# and Java

The .txt files inside the folders are just for testing purposes since DiffMerge or Winmerge

likes to have the same file extensions to list the differences between the files.


Check the .pdf files for differences.

If you are interested in the source code & project files,

they are included as well.
